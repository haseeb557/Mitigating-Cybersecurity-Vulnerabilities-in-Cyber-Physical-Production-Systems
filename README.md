# Mitigating Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities in Cyber-Physical Production Systems

## A Quality-Oriented Petri Net Framework with Digital Checkpoints

## Abstract

This research extends the QualSec framework by introducing a novel approach to mitigation strategies for Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs). The enhanced framework addresses the critical gap between cybersecurity threats and product quality by integrating proactive defense mechanisms called **digital checkpoints** into Quality-Oriented Petri Nets (QOPNs).

## Key Features

- **AutomationML Integration**: Automated parsing of manufacturing system models
- **Ontological Modeling**: Semantic representation of vulnerabilities and system components
- **Digital Checkpoints**: Proactive defense mechanisms integrated into Petri net models
- **Real-time Threat Mitigation**: Dynamic response to cybersecurity incidents
- **Quality Impact Assessment**: Quantitative analysis of how cyber threats affect product quality

## Framework Components

### 1. AutomationML Parsing and Ontological Modeling
- Extracts structured data from AutomationML files
- Converts manufacturing system data into semantic ontologies
- Maps relationships between components, processes, and vulnerabilities

### 2. Enhanced Petri Net Construction
- **Places (P)**: System states including cyber-risks and product impacts
- **Transitions (T)**: Attack scenarios and mitigation activations
- **Arcs (A)**: Vulnerability propagation pathways with dynamic rerouting
- **Marking (M)**: Current system state and active defense mechanisms

### 3. Risk Identification Engine
- **SHACL**: Constraint definitions for vulnerability detection
- **SPARQL**: Query language for identifying critical vulnerabilities
- **RDF**: Structured data representation for device properties

### 4. Reachability Analysis
- Maps potential attack paths through the system
- Identifies quality control bypass opportunities
- Evaluates defense mechanism effectiveness

## Mathematical Model

### Mitigation Success Probability
```
S = min(100, max(0, R Ã— M))
```

Where:
- **S**: Success probability of mitigation strategy (%)
- **R**: Base success rate by risk level
  - High risk: 30%
  - Medium risk: 50%
  - Low risk: 80%
- **M**: Effectiveness factor of mitigation strategy
  - Patch/Update Software: 1.1
  - Strong Authentication: 1.2
  - Encrypt Sensitive Data: 1.3
  - Network Segmentation: 1.25

## Research Objectives

1. **Automated CPPS Detection**: AML parser for semantic modeling towards OWL ontology creation
2. **Attack Scenario Modeling**: Petri Nets with digital checkpoints for cybersecurity risk handling
3. **Vulnerability Identification**: SHACL and SPARQL rules for risk detection
4. **Reachability Analysis**: Mapping possible quality control bypasses
5. **Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive cybersecurity risk evaluation with mitigation recommendations

## Key Findings

### Risk Distribution
- **50%** Medium risk scenarios
- **35%** High risk scenarios  
- **15%** Low risk scenarios

### Mitigation Effectiveness
- **40-50%** risk reduction in High risk scenarios
- **20-30%** risk reduction in Medium risk scenarios

### Critical Vulnerabilities
- Weak Access Controls
- Unpatched Software Systems
- Insecure IoT Devices
- Inadequate Network Segmentation

## Simulation Results

The framework successfully demonstrated:
- Integration of cybersecurity and quality control domains
